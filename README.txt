Current state of the project (9/3/15):
Re-writing this buddy in Haskell. Let's do it!

Left to do:
* Figure out best way to encode the ticks from ^ that/those tracks into tempFile
** Mostly trying to efficiently find noteLength and to encode with readable timestamps
* Figure out how to parse tempFile and write notation simultaneously
* Make it clean and beautiful

Thank you for checking out my midi translator!

Soon to come:
    -mp3 and .flac translations
	-web-page support
