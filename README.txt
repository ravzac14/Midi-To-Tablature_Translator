Current state of the project (9/3/15):
Re-writing this buddy in Haskell. Let's do it!

Left to do:
* Parse for drum track(s) in a smart way
* Figure out best way to encode the ticks from ^ that/those tracks into tempFile
* Decide whether to reformat in tempFile or just write to the outFile while parsing the tempFile
* Make it clean and beautiful

Thank you for trying out my midi translator!

Soon to come:
    -mp3 and .flac translations
	-To-file support
	-web-page support
